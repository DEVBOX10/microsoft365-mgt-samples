## Typos, minor updates, or fixes to existing samples

Whenever you are submitting any changes to the PnP repositories, please follow these recommendations.

* Always fork repository to your own account for applying modifications
* Do not combine multiple changes to one pull request, please submit for example any samples and documentation updates using separate PRs
* If you are submitting multiple samples, please create specific PR for each of them
* If you are submitting typo or documentation fix, you can combine modifications to single PR where suitable
