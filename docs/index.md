The [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/toolkit/overview) is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic components and authentication providers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.

You can use the [Microsoft Graph Toolkit Playground](https://aka.ms/mgt/dev/) to try using the various components.

The samples on this page are a curated list of community-contributed samples using the Microsoft Graph Toolkit. 

You can filter samples by keyword or author.

To learn more about how to use these samples, please refer to our [getting started](./gettingstarted/index.md) section.
