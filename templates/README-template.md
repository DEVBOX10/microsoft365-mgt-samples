# Title of the sample

<!--
This is how you want the sample to appear in the samples browser.
When naming your sample, try to give it a friendly name that describes what it does. Avoid using terms like `mgt` and `graph` -- because that's what all the samples in this repo is all about. Also, don't use `React`, `Angular`, `JavaScript`, etc. in your sample title -- unless that's what the sample is about.
GOOD 👍:
  Kitten Videos
BAD 👎:
  react-mgt-kittenvideos
