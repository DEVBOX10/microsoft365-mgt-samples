This repository contains community samples that demonstrate different usage patterns for the Microsoft Graph Toolkit.

> We do welcome community contributions to the samples folder in this repository for demonstrating different use cases with the Microsoft Graph Toolkit. Notice that if you use 3rd party libraries, please make sure that library license allows distributions of it as part of your sample.

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic components and authentication providers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.
